# Finally you're here............
I'm Sharon Ololade Kolade. I'm a web developer still on a run to perfection, in my journey, I fell in love with HTML, CSS and Javascript

In my journey on CSS, tailwind and Sass has been my companion.
I'm currently threading the pathof Javascript, and yes it has been quite challenging but awesome.
My affectionfor this path is beyond my expectations and I'm confident I'll excel here.
I want to get my hands dirty, so I'm looking forward to collaborations, projects and everything that will help my journey to perfection in this field.
